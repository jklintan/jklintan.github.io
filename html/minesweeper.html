            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This is my own version of the traditional Minesweeper game. It was a personal project and
                I implemented
                it in Processing programming language. I wanted it to be a bit unique so it has the theme and appearance
                of radioactive bombs and
                the player needs to save the world from them.
            </p>
            <p>I was challenged by a friend to code a Minesweeper game where we both chose a different coding language
                and implemented the game logic. I had a great time to explore how all the game rules and logic works in
                the classic Minesweeper and to
                figure out how I should
                implement it. Afterwards I spent some time to clean up the code and make it more generalized.
            </p>

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>

            <p>When starting this project it was essential to look into how the game logic for a Minesweeper game is
                made. I researched a lot
                and when implementing I followed the game logic walkthrough that CodeBuild has explained <a
                    href="http://codebuild.blogspot.com/2015/01/algorithms-explained-minesweeper-game.html"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Initialization</h2>
            <p>The first thing I started with was to create the board. The board is represented by a 2D matrix of colors
                where the color of each item
                in the matrix is depending on the state of that particular "cell". The number of mines is a
                predetermined number and I setup the board
                by generating a random index for each mine and place the mine there (if no mine is placed there before)
                and if a mine is placed I store true
                in an array that represents the "bombstate" for all the cells.
            </p>

            <p>Each cell also needs to have a "count" on how many mines that particular cell is neighbour to. In the
                initialization I go through
                the whole board and for each cell it updates the count for each neighbouring cell. When this is done the
                numbers are stored in an array and
                the board is drawn. Another array is used to store if a cell is opened or not, in the beginning all is
                closed.
            </p>

            <div class="subfloat">

                <img src="../img/projects/minedev.png" />
                Setting up of a grid with square cells. In early development I used grey colors and red to mark the
                mines. Each cell contains info about mines, flagged, opened and number of neighbouring mines.
            </div>

            <h2>Game logic</h2>
            <p>Each time that the player left clicks on a cell that cell is being marked as opened. If the cell contains
                a mine, the player loses, otherwise
                keep playing. If a cell is opened that has 0 mines as neighbours I use an auxiliary function that check
                the surroundings around that cell, opens them up and check
                for more zeros. It is recursive so if a neighbouring cell also are 0, that cells surroundings are opened
                as well.
            </p>

            <p>When the player right clicks on a cell, that cell is being marked as flagged and the player believes that
                it contains a mine. That cell is
                still marked as closed but if the player later on left clicks on it, it will be opened. The player can't
                close a cell once it is opened.
            </p>

            <p>If all cells that contains a mine has being marked as flagged and all the other cells has being marked as
                opened, the player wins. </p>

                Adding of the function that opens up neighbouring cells if a mine has 0 neighbouring mines.
            </div>

            <p>This was a fun project that I learned a lot from, even though I would like to improve it further by
                optimizing the
                data structures used (only use 2D arrays to remove the convertion step with the index for example) and
                to divide the
                steps into more functions to keep the setup and draw functions more clean.
