            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This is a completely procedural shader implemented in Unity using HLSL, implemented as a
                course project (3 ECTS) in the course
                'Procedural Methods for Images' at Linköping University. Procedural generation of images is a versatile
                and often used tool in modern computer graphics.
                The course aims at giving a deep and general knowledge of classic and modern methods for procedural
                generation of images,
                particularly textures meant to emulate complex and visually detailed phenomena in nature.
            </p>

            <p>With the sole use of mathematical equations,
                a surface shader are built and attached to a plane which gives the impression of a ocean. With diﬀerent
                parameters available for the user,
                the ocean can change shape and appearance. The approach used is a combination of displacements in the
                vertex shader, surface noise and
                some lighting eﬀects in the fragment shader as well as using depth for creating foam around objects.
            </p>

            <p> The resulting shader has been built both as a stand-alone feature in Unity and also combined into a
                demonstration scene and published online using WebGL.</p>

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>

            <p>The use of procedural methods is important when it comes to coding for computer graphics and when
                creating simulations.
                By simulating complex systems in procedural ways, we can lower memory cost and achieve a faster
                simulation speed,
                textures that have memory cost can be replaced by equations and by this also being more easy to change
                for further use.
                The focus of this project was to use only procedural methods to code and generate a shader that
                simulates an ocean.
            </p>

            <h2>Large wave displacement</h2>

            <p>The ﬁrst thing that was implemented in the project was the displacement to create large waves.
                The calculations for this was performed in the vertex shader.
                The ﬁrst thing to do was to make sure the displacement worked and could be animated.
                Therefor, the ﬁrst implementation contained the simplest wave shape, a sinusoidal wave.
            </p>

            <p>When successfully added the displacement, it was seen that sinusoidal waves hardly creates a realistic
                appearance of waves.
                Sinus waves move only up and down but real waves instead move both backward and forward as more water
                ﬁlls up underneath the top waves.
                The focus is still on keeping the simulations as simple as possible but a further extension of taking
                the displacement from
                sinusoidal waves into trochoidal waves are made.
                A trochoidal wave describes a progressive wave which creates sharper crests and ﬂat throughs.</p>

            <div class="subfloat">
                Trochoidal waves
            </div>

            <p>The next step of creating more realistic waves is to add multiple trochoidal waves to the scene. In the
                real world, a single and uniform wave are hardly ever seen. Instead multiple waves with slight diﬀerent
                phase speed and height act together in an ocean. Therefor the calculations for a trochoidal wave are
                taken out of the vertex shader and instead implemented as a function that returns the correct
                displacement and normal calculations.
                The waves have a slight diﬀerence in direction and phase from each other and creates together a much
                more realistic appearance.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Small wave displacement</h2>
            <p>The next step was the implementation of small waves, the ripples across the surface. The full eﬀect of
                this was done by both an additional displacement of the vertices in the vertex shader and also some
                addings in the fragment shader.
            </p>

            <p>I returned to a simple plane without the large wave displacement to easily being able to see the
                adjustments. The plan for the small waves was to add noise to the new calculated vertices after the
                large wave displacement, and to then add noise to the height (y-coordinate) in the normal direction. The
                noise used for the displacement are all included as separate cginc ﬁles from <a
                    href="https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise">github.com/ashima</a>.
            </p>

            <p> I struggled a lot with not getting that cloud-like feeling of the noise that I aimed for and realized
                that the frequency and especially the level of detail of the noise needed to be adjusted.
                Therefor a function that adds series of Perlin noise with diﬀerent octaves was implemented. The function
                creates a 2D noise pattern but uses a 3D noise function for being able to animate according to the time.
                The multioctave noise function was tested in the fragment shader as output for the color to being able
                to visualize if the pattern was the one aiming for. </p>

            <div class="subfloat">
                Noise series with different octaves
            </div>

            <p>The resulting ripples along the surface are a combination of noises with diﬀerent octaves. The noise has a time-parameter that creates an animated movement up and down for the ripples. The result for the plane without inﬂuence of the large wave displacement can be seen in the images below. With an extension of letting the number of octaves and amount of displacement be driven by the user as properties in the shader, the resulting ripples could be integrated with the large wave displacement and together, the two displacements creates a much more appealing perception of the water.</p>

            <div class="subfloat">

            <h2>Foam</h2>

            <p>The two displacements together creates a rather good appearance of an ocean. The next step is to move over to adjustments in the fragment shader. One big improvement for realism is to add foam to the ocean. Water in an ocean splashes around and creates foam, as well as foamlines and depth perception around the shallow parts of a water mass.</p>

            <p>To simulate the foam that occurs around objects in the water and along the shoreline, a gradient is added that is controlled by the depth of objects under the water. To be able to use the depth values, the camera depth texture are used. To being able to read the camera’s depth texture, and by this determining how far each vertex is from the camera, it is needed to enable the depth texture for the camera.</p>

            <p>The depth value texture is then sampled for each vertex’s screenposition. It exists a number of depth texture shader helper macros in Unity and after the texture is sampled, the corresponding eye space depth are calculated using the LinearEyeDepth helper macro.
                The eye depth are calculated in the vertex shader and added as an attribute for each vertex to being able to send this to the fragment shader. After making sure the depth texture exists, the gradient are calculated.  Finally, a check if the current vertex is inside the fading are and should be colored with foam or not and colored if it is. Since the water could be inﬁnite deep, this fading limit ﬂag has been added.
            </p>

            <div class="subfloat">
                Foamline around objects using depth texture
            </div>

            <p>Another aspect of the large waves in reality is that it forms foam on top of the waves and also a breaking of the waves since the top of the wave travels at a greater speed.
                The height foam is implemented by looking at the y-coordinate of each vertex. If it is above a certain limit, foam should be added</p>

            <p>As with the shoreline foam, a gradient is implemented and further more, a multioctave noise is added as well. This noise is added to the gradient in such a way that only the light parts of the noise are added, in order to create a foam-like appearance.
            </p>

            <p> For creating an even more realistic ocean, more emphasized foam could have been added but I thought that the inﬂuence of the gradient noise created a nice additional realism in the scene and when testing diﬀerent amounts of noise I found that it easily went over to an almost cartoon impression when too much.

            <h2>Lighting</h2>

            <p>The shader was implemented as a standard surface shader that uses a local light model. Even though the light model was quite suﬃcient in some aspects, I wanted to add some features for creating an even more realistic ocean.
            </p>

            <p>The lighting eﬀect that I started implementing was the Fresnel eﬀect. This eﬀect simulates reﬂections on a surface. When the viewer looks at the surface from a steep angle, it will get less reﬂections compared to when looking from a shallow angle. 
                This means that for the ocean, there should be more reﬂections from the light in the distance and less close by. I implemented this eﬀect in the fragment shader by ﬁrst ﬁnding the view direction, that is the normalized vector between the camera’s position and the screenposition for the current vertex, and then calculating the angle between each normal and the view direction. Finally a smooth value is calculated by using a step function and interpolation with a user deﬁned value for the inﬂuence of the eﬀect.
            </p>

            <h2>Parameterization</h2>

            <p>The ﬁnal thing performed for the actual shader in this project was to merge the diﬀerent properties available for the user in a good way. It is not so intuitive for everyone how to interact with the large waves according to amplitude and wavelength, instead
                an approach of parameterization was used to change the wave height and steepness according to the wind.
                </p>

            <p>For this, a wind direction vector was added as a property and the trochoidal wave function was given an extra input parameter that was the direction of the wave. This enables a user to change the wavedirection.</p>


            <p>Additionally, the wave height are described with the use of the property wind strength where a higher wind strength creates larger waves, and the amount of waves are described by the property wind frequency. This allows for the user to both create a stormy ocean with large waves but also a windy ocean with lots of small waves. To avoid the issues with looping, a third trochoidal wave is only added if the wave strength are below a certain limit.
            </p>

            <p>The shader is interactive as it is with properties that allows a user to create diﬀerent eﬀects and the ocean they are aiming for but I wanted to create a demonstration of the shader online as well. To do this I created an additional demo scene where I added a graphical user interface with sliders for inputs and connected them to the shader with a simple C# script. I then built this scene for WebGL and uploaded it in connection to my <a href="https://github.com/jklintan/Procedural-Water">Github repositry</a> for the project.</p>

            <div class="subfloat">
                Interactive demo scene
            </div>

            <p>Since the shader has lots of diﬀerent properties and I wanted to avoid a GUI that was too clustered, I excluded the possibility for choosing color and the inﬂuence of the Fresnel eﬀect but as mentioned before, they are all available when using the shader itself in Unity.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, a completely procedural shader was successfully implemented and fulﬁlls its goal of simulating an ocean in a realistic and eﬃcient way. Obviously it exists many additional features that could be added, such as particle systems for simulating water splashes on top of the waves or when hitting objects in the ocean, but that moves away from the procedural aim of this project and will be a possible continuation in order to turn the project into a complete ocean tool for Unity.
