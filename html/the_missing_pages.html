            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This game was created during the Skyfox Game Jam in Norrk√∂ping 2019. Me and my friend
                Embla decided to
                create a 2D explorer game where the main character explores the world of books.</p>
            <p>The plot is around the girl Fabula who lives in the world of books. She has a library and someone has
                broken in and
                stolen pages from different books. The players mission is to restore the library by travelling through
                doors that
                leads to fairytales and find the missing pages. Once a level is completed, that book is shown in Fabulas
                library.
            </p>
            <p>The game was created using Unity and Embla was responsible for the graphics and I did the game design and
                coding. </p>

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>

            <p>We started out with brainstorming and deciding what we wanted to do during the game jam. One of the
                themes suggested
                was 'Little Worlds' and from this we got inspiration to use our favorite books for the game. We wanted a
                "base" environment
                from where the player can reach different levels and we decided to make the first level Narnia and that
                got us into using
                waredrobes as portals to the different worlds.
            </p>

                <img src="../img/projects/worldOfBooks3.png" /></div>

            <p>The game starts out with a background explanation of the main character Fabula. For this section I coded
                a dialogue manager that handles
                the conversations. This script uses a queue of strings where the sentences is enqueued. Then each
                character in the sentences is dequeued with
                a small delay and this results in the slow appearance of the words.</p>

            <img src="../img/projects/worldOfBooks.png" />

            <p>The main character has a player controller script where I used a rigid body to control her motions.
                Horizontal and vertical movement is
                performed by adding vectors to the velocity. The character can also jump after firstly checking if the
                character is grounded or not.
                In this script I also handle the animations as well as finding the position of different game objects
                (done by searching for the correct tag)
                to enable the player to interact with characters and travel into different levels.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/projects/pages.png" />

            <p>In the Narnia level, the player needs to find three lost pages. The pages have a script attached which
                makes the count in the top corner add a point
                for each collected page. In this level the plot states that the Ice Queen has placed out traps that the
                player needs to conquer. This is enemy objects that
                falls from the sky and if the player is hit, the player returns to the main level. The enemy objects is
                spawned at different heights and places with randomly
                selected vertical velocity (within a boundary).</p>

            <img src="../img/projects/enemy.png" />

            <p>When the level is completed the player returns to the main level again. If all the three missing pages
                has been collected then this level is saved as
                completed in a global variable and the book that represents this level appears in Fabulas library.
            </p>

            <p>During the Game Jam we only managed to complete one level but the portals to two others is in the game
                and it can easily be expanded When
                we got some time to spare. A fun weekend and we are proud of the work we accomplished during two days.
