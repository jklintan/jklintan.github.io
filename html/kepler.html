            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This project was part of the course Numerical Analysis at KTH. The task was to solve the
                Kepler problem approximately over long time
                using different numerical methods. Then we compared the difference between the different methods. </p>

            <p>The main purpose was to study Hamiltonian systems and thereby we needed to prove that the Kepler
                Equations is
                a Hamiltonian system. We used forward Euler, backward Euler, symplectic Euler, midpoint method and ode45
                as different numerical ways to
                solve the Kepler problem.
            </p>

            <p>The project was further continued with pure mathematical parts where we numrically solved other
                Hamiltonian systems as the Wave Equation (using d'Alemberts formula) and the Schrodinger Equation as
                well as
                investigated the Verlets method. The main conclusion of the project was that it is an advantage to use
                symplectic Euler when solving
                Hamiltonian systems in a numerical way since this approach conserves the energy in the best way of the
                different methods. </p>




            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>

            <p>The Kepler Problem looks like following: </p>

            <center><img src="../img/projects/keplerProblem.png" /></center>

            <p>For a Hamiltonian system the following equation is satisfied and further we proved that the energy is
                constant for any Hamiltonian system (for the exact solution). </p>

            <center><img src="../img/projects/hamiltonian.png" /></center>

            <p>To being able to compare the different numerical methods we plotted the trajectories in a 2D coordinate
                system. Since the Kepler problem equations describe the
                so called "two body problem" where two bodies attracts eachother. Newton prooved mathematically that the
                trajectory
                turns out to be an elliptical shape with an excentricity a that is between 0 and 1.
            </p>

            <p>Below you can find the trajectories for the forward Euler, backward Euler, midpoint-method and symplectic
                Euler.</p>

            <center><img src="../img/projects/euler2.png" /></center>


            <p>We continued on with plotting the energy as function of time for the different methods: </p>

            <center><img src="../img/projects/energy.png" /></center>

            <p>We could see that the different methods have different energy preservance. In the forward Euler, the
                energy goes up with time and
                the opposite for the backward Euler (which means that the planet trajectory goes inwards towards the
                center of the ellips).
            </p>

            <p>For the other two methods (midpoint and symplectic) the energy is almost constant over time and we can
                see this in the trajectories since
                they are moving in the same trajectory (not going inwards or outwards). Since we know that planets move
                in constant trajectories we conclude that
                the two last methods are the best to use for numerical solution in the Kepler case.
            </p>

            <p>We did the same analysis for the ode45 in Matlab and we could see that the trajectory quickly falled into
                the middle and thereby
                concluded that this is not a preferable method for simulating trajectories.
            </p>
