            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">SuperSnail is a short animated movie about a snail that suddenly gets superpowers and has
                to deal with the consequences. The movie was created during the course Digital Media at Linköping
                University and created using the 3D modelling software Blender.
            </p>

            <p>SuperSnail was created as part of a course at Linköping University. The goal of the group was to create
                an animated movie from scratch and deepen our knowledges in 3D modelling softwares. We
                chose to use Blender since all group members had easy access to the software.
            </p>

            <p>My responsibilities in the project was partly story and storyboard. I created the snail in Blender,
                including modelling, texturing, rigging and facial expressions. I animated some scenes. I created the
                sound effects for the snail.

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>
            <p>Our project group decided together to create a story involving a snail. We started exploring ideas and I
                sketched up a simple storyboard that
                we used for our upcoming work. </p>

            <img src="../img/projects/storyboard.png" />

            <p>We split the work of modelling between us in the project group and my main responsability was to design
                the snail and create a rig for it.
                I searched for inspirational images and pretty soon I had a body for the snail and eyes but it was hard
                to settle on a good design for the shell.
                Eventually I chose a simple spiral and attached it on the top of the snail's back. The textures are all
                imagebased and added to the body by UV-unwrapping.
            </p>

            <p>
                I rigged the snail by straight joints through the body and then two parallell joints up through the
                eyes. In this way we could animate body motion
                for the snail and also add some emotional expressions with the eyes. I still wanted to being able to
                animate more emotions than this so I
                added different facial expressions as shape keys where I changed the direction of the mouth and also
                added different textures for the eyes so the
                eyes could be percieved as opening and closing.
            </p>

            <p>
                We made a "base" kitchen scene that we all used and in this way we could work parallell with each other
                and render images from Blender as soon as
                our animations were done. My animations where the shot when the snail is entering in the first place and
                travels throughout the scene until the towel has
                fallen over him.
            </p>

            <p>
                The snail's motions was key framed and the camera is almost stationary when getting the wide shots. The
                scene with the falling towel is done
                by key framing both a camera looking up and using a cloth simulation on the towel. In the end the towel
                also needed some key framing to get it to fall perfectly
                over the camera to cover it for the purpose of the next scene.

                We rendered all images on computers at Linköping University and due to the large number of
                scenes we had created and the somewhat limited perfomance of the computers we rendered on
                multiple computers at once.
            </p>

            <p>
                The post processing work consisted of recording sound effects. I used my own voice for the snail
                and recorded different background noises to fill up the scenes.
            </p>

            <p>
                One group member focused on fixing the ending scene with the glass window in After Effects and then
                we all helped putting together the entire film in Premiere Pro.

                We were all pleased with the result of the project. It was our first animated movie and we learned a
                lot in the process!
