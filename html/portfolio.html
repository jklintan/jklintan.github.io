            <p class="cursive">SuperSnail is a short animated movie about a snail that suddenly gets superpowers and has
                to deal with the consequences. The movie was created during the course Digital Media at Linköping
                University and created using the 3D modelling software Blender.</p>
            <p>SuperSnail was created as part of a course at Linköping University. The goal of the group was to create
                an animated movie from scratch and deepen our knowledges in 3D modelling softwares. We
                chose to use Blender since all group members had easy access to the software.
            </p>
            <p>My responsibilities in the project was partly story and storyboard. I created the snail in Blender,
                including modelling, texturing, rigging and facial expressions. I animated some scenes. I created the
                sound effects for the snail.

            <p class="cursive">With the combination of wanting to practice shader coding and watching the Khan Academy
                "Pixar in a box" that talked about Voronoi Pattern I decided to create a fragment shader for this
                purpose.</p>
            <p>I started out with a simple scene in OpenGL with a single square. I used the vertex shader to send
                positions and normals of the points on the square to the fragment shader. </p>
            <p>The fragment shader implements the Voronoi pattern by placing a set number of seeds randomly over the
                surface and then calculating the distances to the nearest seed for all other points.
                The points that have the same distances to more than one seed is highlighted and creates the borders
                around the cells. All points within one cell has the smallest distance to that particular seed than to
                any other.
            </p>
            <p>The project was developed further by integrating Phongs local reflection model as well as using a sphere
                instead of a square. </p>

            <p class="cursive">This game was created during the Skyfox Game Jam in Norrköping 2019. Me and my friend
                Embla decided to
                create a 2D platform game where the main character explores the world of books.</p>
            <p>The plot is around the girl Fabula who lives in the world of books. She has a library and someone has
                broken in and
                stolen pages from different books. The players mission is to restore the library by travelling through
                doors that
                leads to fairytales and find the missing pages. Once a level is completed, that book is shown in Fabulas
                library.
            </p>
            <p>The game was created using Unity and Embla was responsible for the graphics and I did the game design and
                coding. </p>

            <p>Our inspiration for this project was to create a scene that was somewhere between fantasy and reality
                where
                we could get a magical and low lightning environment where the light falls nicely on our models.

                details
                and patterns. I spent a lot of time texturing the chair and I also helped with choices and inputs
                regarding textures
                in the whole scene.

            <p>The main task for the project was to set up an OpenGL environment in Visual Studio and learn how to

                it in Processing programming language. I wanted it to be a bit unique so it has the theme and appearance
                of radioactive bombs and
                the player needs to save the world from them.
            </p>
            <p>I was challenged by a friend to code a Minesweeper game where we both chose a different coding language
                and implemented the game logic. I had a great time to explore how all the game rules and logic works in
                the classic Minesweeper and to
                figure out how I should implement it. Afterwards I spent some time to clean up the code and make it more
                generalized.
