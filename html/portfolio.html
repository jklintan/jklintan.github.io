                    <p class="cursive">SuperSnail is a short animated movie about a snail that suddenly gets superpowers and has
                        to deal with the consequences. The movie was created during the course Digital Media at Linköping
                        University and created using the 3D modelling software Blender.</p>
                    <p>SuperSnail was created as part of a course at Linköping University. The goal of the group was to create
                        an animated movie from scratch and deepen our knowledges in 3D modelling softwares. We
                        chose to use Blender since all group members had easy access to the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>My responsibilities in the project was partly story and storyboard. I created the snail in Blender,
                        including modelling, texturing, rigging and facial expressions. I animated some scenes. I created the
                        sound effects for the snail.

        <div class="info">
                <p class="cursive"> This project was performed with the overall purpose of creating an application where people can gain information and learn about flocking algorithms in a fun and interactive way. A secondary task was to extend the simulation and investigate how parts of the implemented algorithm could be used as core mechanics for a computer game. 
                        The project was performed as part of the course 'AI for interactive media' (TNM095) at Linköping University during the fall of 2019. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Minion MAIhem started out as a flocking simulation that implements the classical boids algorithm as proposed by Craig Reynolds. The algorithm
                        was further extended with leader following, enemies, flock separation and obstacle avoidance. The simulation had the main focus on learning 
                        the user how the different steering rules affect the appearance of a flock. The game was created using the enemy avoidance in the flocking simulation. The player needs to gather a number of minions and drive them home inside 
                        a fence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was implemented using Unity and conducted during 4 weeks.

                <p class="cursive">This game was created as part of the course 'Design of Computer Games' (TDDD23) at Linköping University during 
                        6 weeks in the fall of 2019. The aim of the project was to create a gaming prototype with focus on design details, communication, progression and 
                        skill level for the player. </p>
                    <p>Shades is a horrorthemed RPG game that evolves around an unnamed character in a dark, black and white world. The player has to lead the 
                        character forward with the hope of getting out of the shadows and on the way they encounter small colorful objects and characters. 
                        Core game mechanics is changing between 3D view and top-down view, click-and-point interaction and inventory handling, the player needs to collect items to use in different ways. 
                        While escaping from shadow creatures, getting lost in a maze, a forest and a cemetary, the player slowly unravels who they are and 
                        what has happened. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The game was created using Unity and all design has been implemented through Unity Asset Store for being able to fully focus on
                        game play and coding. It was an individual project and performed during the time period of 6 weeks (6 ECTS). A screencast/trailer

            <p class="cursive">With the combination of wanting to practice shader coding and watching the Khan Academy
                "Pixar in a box" that talked about Voronoi Pattern I decided to create a fragment shader for this
                purpose.</p>
            <p>I started out with a simple scene in OpenGL with a single square. I used the vertex shader to send
                positions and normals of the points on the square to the fragment shader. </p>
            <p>The fragment shader implements the Voronoi pattern by placing a set number of seeds randomly over the
                surface and then calculating the distances to the nearest seed for all other points.
                The points that have the same distances to more than one seed is highlighted and creates the borders
                around the cells. All points within one cell has the smallest distance to that particular seed than to
                any other.
            </p>
            <p>The project was developed further by integrating Phongs local reflection model as well as using a sphere
                instead of a square. </p>

            <p class="cursive">This is my own version of the traditional Minesweeper game. It was a personal project and
                I implemented
                it in Processing programming language. I wanted it to be a bit unique so it has the theme and appearance
                of radioactive bombs and
                the player needs to save the world from them.
            </p>
            <p>I was challenged by a friend to code a Minesweeper game where we both chose a different coding language
                and implemented the game logic. I had a great time to explore how all the game rules and logic works in
                the classic Minesweeper and to
                figure out how I should implement it. Afterwards I spent some time to clean up the code and make it more
                generalized.
