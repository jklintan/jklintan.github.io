            <p class="cursive">This is a completely procedural shader implemented in Unity using HLSL, implemented as a
                course project (3 ECTS) in the course
                'Procedural Methods for Images' at Linköping University. Procedural generation of images is a versatile
                and often used tool in modern computer graphics.
                The course aims at giving a deep and general knowledge of classic and modern methods for procedural
                generation of images,
                particularly textures meant to emulate complex and visually detailed phenomena in nature.
            </p>
            <p>With the sole use of mathematical equations,
                a surface shader are built and attached to a plane which gives the impression of a ocean. With diﬀerent
                parameters available for the user,
                the ocean can change shape and appearance. The approach used is a combination of displacements in the
                vertex shader, surface noise and
                some lighting eﬀects in the fragment shader as well as using depth for creating foam around objects.
            </p>

            <p> The resulting shader has been built both as a stand-alone feature in Unity and also combined into a
                demonstration scene and published online using WebGL. The project was conducted during 2 weeks (3 ECTS).

                users gain insight in the Bechdel test and
                investigating connections between genres and female representation within the film industry.
                The project was performed as part of the course 'Information Visualization' (TNM048) at Linköping
                University during the winter of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>The data for the project is consisting of two datasets, both acquired through Kaggle. One is a set of the
                5000 most popular movies from the
                website IMDb between 1970 and 2013, and the other one is a dataset containing Bechdel data for around
                2000 movies. The datasets are concatenated
                and analysed through a Python script that outputs a json-file.</p>
            <p>The visualization is implemented using Javascript d3 library and is based on a radial sequence approach
                where each movie is represented as a circle and displayed with a distance from the center that
                corresponds to the production year of the movie. The gross income for the movie is mapped through the
                radius of the circle and the user can filter movies
                according to Behdel data as well as display more detailed information of individual movies by hovering.

            <p class="cursive"> This project was performed with the overall purpose of creating an application where
                people can gain information and learn about flocking algorithms in a fun and interactive way. A
                secondary task was to extend the simulation and investigate how parts of the implemented algorithm could
                be used as core mechanics for a computer game.
                The project was performed as part of the course 'AI for interactive media' (TNM095) at Linköping
                University during the fall of 2019.
            </p>
            <p>Minion MAIhem started out as a flocking simulation that implements the classical boids algorithm as
                proposed by Craig Reynolds. The algorithm
                was further extended with leader following, enemies, flock separation and obstacle avoidance. The
                simulation had the main focus on learning
                the user how the different steering rules affect the appearance of a flock. The game was created using
                the enemy avoidance in the flocking simulation. The player needs to gather a number of minions and drive
                them home inside
                a fence.
            </p>

                The project was implemented using Unity and conducted during 4 weeks.

                Linköping University during
                6 weeks in the fall of 2019. The aim of the project was to create a gaming prototype with focus on
                design details, communication, progression and
                skill level for the player. </p>
            <p>Shades is a horrorthemed RPG game that evolves around an unnamed character in a dark, black and white
                world. The player has to lead the
                character forward with the hope of getting out of the shadows and on the way they encounter small
                colorful objects and characters.
                Core game mechanics is changing between 3D view and top-down view, click-and-point interaction and
                inventory handling, the player needs to collect items to use in different ways.
                While escaping from shadow creatures, getting lost in a maze, a forest and a cemetary, the player slowly
                unravels who they are and
                what has happened.
            </p>
            <p>The game was created using Unity and all design has been implemented through Unity Asset Store for being
                able to fully focus on
                game play and coding. It was an individual project and performed during the time period of 6 weeks (6
                ECTS). A screencast/trailer

            <p class="cursive">SuperSnail is a short animated movie about a snail that suddenly gets superpowers and has
                to deal with the consequences. The movie was created during the course Digital Media at Linköping
                University and created using the 3D modelling software Blender.</p>
            <p>SuperSnail was created as part of a course at Linköping University. The goal of the group was to create
                an animated movie from scratch and deepen our knowledges in 3D modelling softwares. We
                chose to use Blender since all group members had easy access to the software.
            </p>
            <p>My responsibilities in the project was partly story and storyboard. I created the snail in Blender,
                including modelling, texturing, rigging and facial expressions. I animated some scenes. I created the
                sound effects for the snail.
