			<p class="about_page">My name is <a href="about.html">Josefine Klintberg</a> and I'm an ambitious girl who loves coding and its applications within games, simulation and visualization. 
				I've got a BSc in Engineering Physics from KTH and currently I'm studying a <a href="https://liu.se/studieinfo/en/program/6cmen/4206"></a>MSc in Media Technology and Engineering</a> at Linköping University.
				In the future I want to keep visualizing extraordinary things, and code them into reality!

			<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Do you know how it feels to be truly and completely passionate about a topic? I didn't until I fell in love with coding and its applications within computer graphics and simulation. 
				I've always had a great interest in mathematics, logic and problem solving and this made me start studing Engineering Physics at KTH in Stockholm. 
			</p>

				<p>At KTH <a class="yellow">I went to my first class in computer programming and everything fell into place</a>. Coding managed to combine both my technical and creative side and I 
					started doing lots of coding in my free time. I went on to a semester abroad in Dublin where I did my degree project by programming a small self driven vehicle and realised that
					I wanted to dive full on into the coding world and especially its applications within computer graphics and simulations. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefor I started studying MSc in Media Technology and Engineering at Linköping Universityand now I get to spend everyday learning about topics that drives me to 
					learn and explore more. I want to inspire more people, and especially girls, to try out coding and I get to do that both by working as a Student Ambassador and as a blogger at
					the non-profit organisation Datatjej. 
					<a class="yellow">I dream about a future where I get to work with coding towards simulations and rendering within VFX, games or scientific visualization</a>.
