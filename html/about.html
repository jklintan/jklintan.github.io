            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Josefine Klintberg and long story short, I'm a girl who fell in love with coding and computer
                graphics. I've got a strong fondation in a BSc in Engineering Physics and currently I'm studying a MSc
                in Media Technology and Engineering at Linköping University. </p>
            <p>Coding towards computer graphics combines my technical and creative side in the perfect way. Since I was
                a kid I've loved animated movies, films and playing video games.
                In the future I want to work within the film or gaming industry in order to create extraordinary
                experiences!
            </p>
