            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This project was a modelling project where the group wanted to focus on texturing and
                rendering
                in a 3D modelling software. It was created as part of a course at Link√∂ping University in 3D Computer
                Graphics.</p>
            <p>Our inspiration for this project was to create a scene that was somewhere between fantasy and reality
                where
                we could get a magical and low lightning environment where the light falls nicely on our models.
            </p>
            <p>My responsibilities in the project was modelling of an old armchair in the scene that had lots of small
                details
                and patterns. I spent a lot of time texturing the chair and I also helped with choices and inputs
                regarding textures
                in the whole scene.
            </p>

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>

            <p>We started with sketching up how our room should look like. We got a bit of inspiration from Dumbledore's
                office
                in Harry Potter and we did a simple model in 3Ds Max where we put square objects where our finished
                models should be placed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Together we made a list of items we wanted to have in the room and then each project member chose an
                item to start modelling. I
                wanted to really learn a bunch of different tools in 3Ds Max so I started working on a tutorial for
                modelling an old armchair with lots
                of small details. I put in many hours using free hand modelling from an image and ended up with the
                model below.
            </p>

                <img src="../img/projects/chairdetail.png" />
            </div>

            <p>After the modelling part I started with the texturing. I used image based textures and put out "seems" on
                the model
                to help the texturing. I then used UV-unwrapping for every surface and tweeked until I got a result I
                was pleased with.
                For some parts I could use the built-in unwrapping tool for boxes or planes.</p>

                <img src="../img/projects/chair4.jpg" />
            </div>

            <p>As the models started to take form we imported everything into the room that one of the group members had
                worked on texturing. Together we established some camera angles to get both close ups and overview
                shots. Some
                of the resulting images can be seen below.

            <img src="../img/projects/3d4.jpg" />
            <img src="../img/projects/officeDonev2.jpg" />

            <p>We were pleased with some of the resulting images. We managed to get that magical feeling we were aiming
                for but we
                would've used some different approaches if we were to restart the project. Mainly we should've used more
                light sources
                to highlight the darker areas and get a more compelling image of our modelled items.
