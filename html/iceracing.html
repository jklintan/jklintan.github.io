            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p class="cursive">This project was a hobby project that I created to test out creating a game in Unity. I
                wanted to try out the 3D environment and design a first person view game.
            </p>

            <p>The focus was to test out different techniques and create something that could be played. I started out
                with creating the environment and continued on with adding steering for the player and camera angles.
                Then I continued on with the possibility to collect coins and a timer so the player only has a certain
                time to collect all coins.
            </p>

            <p>Lastly I created a small menu to practice on allowing user input. A small video when playing the game can
                be seen below.
            </p>

            <iframe height="500px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKA6Mv-tHNo" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h1>Technical Walkthrough</h1>
            <p>The game starts with a simple menu that I just added text and buttons to and a small script attached to
                it that saves the users settings for the game. </p>

            <img src="../img/projects/icemenu.png" />

            <p>The Ice World is done just by using a simple plane as start and then adding height to certain places in
                the area. The "car" that the player steers is just a simple capsule that
                is placed in a horizontal position and fixed in this position so that it can't fall to the side. Then a
                velocity and acceleration is added.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/projects/iceworld.png" />

            <p>The coins are placed out randomly and has a hitbox attached so when the players hitbox reaches a coin, it
                disapears and one point adds to the players score. A small sound effect is also added
                for collecting the coins.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/projects/icetime.png" />


            <p>Lastly a timer is implemented that starts when the game starts and the player will get a notice when it
                is 10 seconds left and a counter displays in the bottom of the screen. If the player
                don't collect all coins before the time runs up, the player loses.
            </p>

            <p>This is a game with lots of work left but the purpose of the project was just a fun weekend project to
                get started in the Unity environment.
            </p>
