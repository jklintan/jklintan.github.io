            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Josefine Klintberg and long story short, I'm a girl who fell in love with coding and computer
                graphics. I've got a strong fondation in a BSc in Engineering Physics and currently I'm studying a MSc
                in Media Technology and Engineering at Linköping University. </p>
            <p>Coding towards computer graphics combines my technical and creative side in the perfect way. Since I was
                a kid I've loved animated movies, films and playing video games.
                In the future I want to work within the film or gaming industry in order to create extraordinary
                experiences!

            <h1>What I do. </h1>
            <p>My passion is within computer graphics and it really is the best thing I know to get a visual result of
                my coding. I've been varying courses at university so I
                both get a strong coding foundation with data structures as well as computer graphics courses with focus
                on OpenGL. My strongest programming skills at the moment is
                C++, OpenGL and Python but I am also working on developing my knowledge in GLSL and C#. Apart from these
                I both have explored and am exploring a various other programming languages. </p>
            <p>Most importantly for what I do is that I take all the joy I feel when coding, my passion for graphics and
                my coding skills to combine them into a unique, joyful and strong coder. I
                strive to write good and efficient code that creates something extraordinary.
